This file is automatically updated by the planner and implementer agents:
- **Planner**: Adds new projects to "Not Started" when creating plans
- **Implementer**: Moves projects from "Not Started" to "In Progress" when starting
- **Implementer**: Moves projects from "In Progress" to "Completed" when done

Manual updates are also acceptable.
