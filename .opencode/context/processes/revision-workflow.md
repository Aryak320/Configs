# Revision Workflow

Process for revising existing implementation plans.

## Steps

1. Read existing plan
2. Conduct additional research if needed
3. Create new plan version (v2, v3, etc.)
4. Preserve old version
5. Update metadata
6. Link new research reports
7. Commit to git

## Triggers

- User requests changes
- New requirements discovered
- Implementation blockers found
- Better approach identified

## Output

- New plan version (implementation_vN.md)
- Preserved old versions
- New research reports (if any)
- Git commit
