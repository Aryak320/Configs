# Planning Workflow

Process for creating implementation plans from research.

## Steps

1. Read research OVERVIEW.md
2. Analyze findings
3. Break work into phases
4. Organize phases into waves (parallel execution)
5. Define dependencies
6. Estimate complexity and time
7. Create implementation_v1.md
8. Update TODO.md
9. Commit to git

## Plan Structure

- Phases: Sequential units of work
- Waves: Groups of parallel phases
- Dependencies: Phase prerequisites
- Metadata: Version, status, timestamps

## Output

- Implementation plan file
- Updated TODO.md
- Git commit
